# WebDevPractices

Hello!
This repository contains all my practice projects in Web Development.

I'm open to critique and feedback. I'm still a beginner, so I know some of my code may be quite messy to read, contain a lot of redundancies, and not as efficient as an experienced developer would. So feel free to post a comment where my code can be improved! Thank you.
