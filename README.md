# Web Development Practices

Hello!
This repository contains all my practice projects in Web Development.

I'm open to critique and feedback. I'm still a beginner, so I know some of my code may be quite messy to read, contain a lot of redundancies, and not as efficient as an experienced developer would. So feel free to post a comment where my code can be improved! Thank you.

Note: For reference, I use an online IDE called Replit.
Note2: It is with great regret to inform you, my dearest friends, that my Replit premium subscription has ended. Thus I am regretfully reverting back to VS Code, and will be reaping the consequences of my sins.
